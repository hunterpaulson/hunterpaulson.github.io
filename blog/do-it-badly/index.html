<h1 id="do-it-badly">do it badly</h1>
<p>allegedly “you <em>can</em> just do things” [<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation
needed</a>]. but in order to avoid enacting the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism">politician’s
syllogism</a>, you must focus on doing things that are worth doing. and
<a href="https://www.chesterton.org/a-thing-worth-doing/">if a thing is
worth doing, it is worth doing badly</a>.</p>
<p>your first attempt at anything should be your worst. not your worst
effort, but the worst result you produce from then on. this allows you
to mark your height on the wall. have something tangible that marks the
start of your journey, a benchmark to measure progress against. a
reminder of how far you have come when you get discouraged or lose
focus. it is cathartic to look back and laugh at another you. they are,
after all, <a
href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1325154823856033793">the only person
you should compare yourself to</a>. and the version of you who did it
badly is better off than the version of yourself who hadn’t done
anything yet.</p>
<p>if you want to start writing, like me, write a bad blog <em>and</em>
post it.</p>
<p>if you want to learn gpu programming, go write a memory bound kernel.
last on the leaderboard is still on the leaderboard, so go get on the <a
href="https://leetgpu.com/challenges">leaderboard</a><sup><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>if you want to program satellites, hook up some sensors to a
raspberry pi and <a
href="https://github.com/hunterpaulson/ostrich-demo-sat">orchestrate
them</a> with some flight software. who knows, you may just be
contributing to the <a
href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime">framework</a> a few months
later.</p>
<p>start with the minimum viable commit. it doesn’t have to be good. it
just has to be done.</p>
<p>nobody needs to derive any value from it. except you. its purpose is
to get your personal flywheel turning.</p>
<p>optimally it would be just bad enough that you have the intrinsic
desire to improve upon it.</p>
<h1 id="then-do-it-again">then do it again</h1>
<p>now that you have something done, something real to show for your
time and effort, it is time to do it again. pick one thing you learned
and focus on improving just that.</p>
<p>the whole can still be bad, it just has to be a little better than
v<sub>n</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>1</sub>.</p>
<h1 id="and-again-and-again">and again, and again</h1>
<p>run it back. tighten the feedback loop. get your flywheel spinning
faster and faster. pretty soon you will learn both how much work it
takes to do something exceptional and that you too are capable of
producing exceptional work.</p>
<p>in the limit, your success won’t hinge on how well you started, but
rather on how little time you wasted standing still.</p>
